This project comprised a data-science study about credit card fraud using publicly-available data. Having sourced the data, we studied
the data to identify the key variables that looked likely to influence fraudulent activity. These were then described as significant 
features that we embedded into a machine-learning model that classifies if a credit-card transaction is fraudulent or not. Given the 
large size of the dataset, we trained and tested this machine-learning model on a small fraction of the dataset and used 3-fold cross
validation to keep the training time manageable. We explored the application of 5 machine-learning models, all of which represent
classification models, as this suits the task at hand. We then applied the resulting model to predict the likely cost of fraudulent 
activity on the credit card company based on the model that we had developed, and compare its utility to the prediction that would 
result from simply using a naive model.
